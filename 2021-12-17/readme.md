# Maximal Square

Given an `m x n` binary matrix filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return its area.

### Example 1:
![Example 1](example1.jpg "Example 1")
```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```
### Example 2:
![Example 2](example2.jpg "Example 2")
```
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```
