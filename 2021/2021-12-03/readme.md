# No Adjacent Repeating Characters

This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:

Given a string, rearrange the string so that no character next to each other are the same. If no such arrangement is possible, then return None.

Example:
```
Input: abbccc
Output: cbcbca
```
```python
def rearrangeString(s):
  # Fill this in.

print rearrangeString('abbccc')
# cbcabc
```
