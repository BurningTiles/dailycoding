# Longest Common Prefix

This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix between all strings.

Here's some examples and some starter code.

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(longest_common_prefix(['helloworld', 'hellokitty', 'hell']))
# hell

print(longest_common_prefix(['daily', 'interview', 'pro']))
# ''
```
